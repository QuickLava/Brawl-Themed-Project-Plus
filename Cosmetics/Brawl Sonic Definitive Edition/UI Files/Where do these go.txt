The masq file is P+'s equivalent to the config file that
controls the order of the costumes that show up in menus
and what gets called during matches (also team colors).
It goes in the "costumeslots" folder if using P+.

CSSSlot27 is the Brawl EX / P+EX version of the masq file.

MenSelchrFaceB460 is Sonic's RSP file, converted to
the 50CC system. The one with (RGBA8) is full res,
NOT MEANT FOR CONSOLE USE... unless RSP loading is
at play; in that case you get the order situated then
split it into volumes that fall under loading restrictions
on the results screen.

You can import the MenSelchrFaceB460 file in the CSP section
of the sc_selcharacter.pac. Just be sure that it's compression
is ExtendedLZ77 like the other bbres files that have CSPs.

The InfFace 23XX files are the BPs that were also converted
to the 50CC format. They go in the "portrite" folder.
