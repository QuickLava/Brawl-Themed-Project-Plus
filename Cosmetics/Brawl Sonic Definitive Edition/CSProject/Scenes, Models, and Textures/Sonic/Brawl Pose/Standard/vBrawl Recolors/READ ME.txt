AKA, What Do?

When you first open the blend file, use your arrow keys
to swap between the different outfits and combinations that
are included. This is controlled by the dope sheet.
Later edits can be added to this as unique key frames.

The way this is setup, you can batch render all costumes.
When you go to render, hit "Render Animation" and it should
work. Before doing so, go into the "compositor" and make an
output node with the directory of your choosing for both the
main render and the stock heads. You can adjust the amount of
frames in the animation by going to the "timeline" to account
for additional costumes that you've added beyond the 16.

If you want to add more tints, you'll need to edit a shader
that has the "tint selector" node group and adjust it to your
needs. This will affect ALL shaders that use it.

If you want to add more accessories (that's wild), import the model
and bind it to the shape keys as needed. Don't be afraid to mess around
with the file to see how things work. Otherwise, you can also duplicate
pre-existing models within the file if you want to recolor them.

If you want to add more textures in the image sequences, simply place
it in the appropriate folder.

For other questions, Google is your friend (or whatever you use).
