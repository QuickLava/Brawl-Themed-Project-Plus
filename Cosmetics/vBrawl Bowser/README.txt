This was made to seamlessly merge into your CSProject folder.
Just drag and drop and you're good to go.

There's also a recolor template so you make your own recolors using
gradient maps. I only have .psd files, sorry GIMP users...

If you're using these for any reason in any modpack, all I ask for
is to be credited. Have fun!
