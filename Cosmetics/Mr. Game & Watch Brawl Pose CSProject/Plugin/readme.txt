These plugins are intended to make the resulting cosmetics look as close to their original counterparts as feasibly possible. One is a special version of the batch BP cropper designed to work with a mask and crop instead of just a crop. You'll need this for G&W's BPs. The other two are alternate versions of the batch and standard stock processors which are identical except for the opacity of the stroke layer always being set to zero, in order to replicate the appearance of his Brawl stocks. Furthermore, the batch processor has been given a tweak to ensure that the input files are .pngs. Simply drag the plugins into your Gimp plugin folder in order to use them.
